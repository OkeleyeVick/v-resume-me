	"resumeTips": {
		"Keep It Concise": "Your resume should be clear and concise, ideally limited to one page. Focus on highlighting the most relevant and significant information.",
		"Tailor Your Resume": "Customize your resume for each job application. Identify key skills and experiences the employer seeks and align your resume accordingly.",
		"Contact Information": "Include your full name, professional email address, and a phone number where employers can reach you easily.",
		"Professional Summary/Objective": "Write a brief, targeted summary or objective statement that highlights your key qualifications and career goals.",
		"Work Experience": "List your work experience in reverse chronological order, including the company name, job title, dates of employment, and a concise description of your responsibilities and achievements.",
		"Achievements and Quantifiable Results": "Whenever possible, use specific numbers or metrics to showcase your accomplishments. Quantifiable results help employers understand your impact.",
		"Skills": "Highlight your relevant skills, both technical and soft skills. Be honest about your abilities, as employers may ask you about them during interviews.",
		"Education": "Mention your educational qualifications, including the degree earned, institution, and graduation year. If you have significant work experience, place this section after your work experience.",
		"Reverse Chronological Order": "Organize your resume with the most recent and relevant experiences first.",
		"Use Action Verbs": "Start each bullet point in your work experience section with a strong action verb to showcase your accomplishments actively.",
		"Avoid Typos and Errors": "Proofread your resume carefully to eliminate any spelling or grammatical mistakes. Errors can create a negative impression.",
		"Avoid Unnecessary Personal Information": "Exclude irrelevant personal details like marital status, religious affiliation, etc., unless it's directly related to the job.",
		"Utilize White Space and Bullets": "Make your resume easy to read by using bullet points and leaving enough white space between sections.",
		"Use a Professional Font and Format": "Choose a standard font (e.g., Arial, Times New Roman).",
		"Be Honest": "Represent your skills and experiences accurately. Don't exaggerate or include false information, as it may backfire during the hiring process.",
		"Include Relevant Keywords": "Many companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to scan resumes. Incorporate relevant keywords from the job description to increase your chances of passing the initial screening.",
		"Showcase Continuing Education": "If you have participated in workshops, certifications, or relevant courses, mention them to demonstrate your commitment to learning.",
		"Include Volunteer and Extracurricular Activities": "If relevant, showcase your community involvement and extracurricular achievements, as they can demonstrate valuable qualities to employers.",
		"Use a Professional Email Address": "Avoid using unprofessional email addresses; create a new one if necessary, focused on your name.",
		"Consider a Resume Design": "While the content is essential, a visually appealing resume can make it stand out. However, keep the design simple and professional."
